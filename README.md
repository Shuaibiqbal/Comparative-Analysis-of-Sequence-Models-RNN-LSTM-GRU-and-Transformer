# Comparative-Analysis-of-Sequence-Models-RNN-LSTM-GRU-and-Transformer
This repository serves as a valuable resource for those looking to understand and compare the performance of RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models. Whether you're looking for an introductory tutorial or a deep dive into sequence data modeling, this repository provides the necessary tools and insights to get started.

The repository includes:

- **Model Implementations**: Code for RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models.
- **Performance Metrics**: Side-by-side comparison of model performance.
- **Visualizations**: Graphical representations to visualize the performance of each model.
  
Whether you are new to sequence data modeling or looking for a performance comparison between different architectures, this repository offers a clear, hands-on guide to these models.

## Models Covered

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: A basic architecture for handling sequential data, but can struggle with long-term dependencies.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A specialized type of RNN that overcomes the vanishing gradient problem and is better at learning long-term dependencies.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**: A simplified version of LSTM, designed to be computationally efficient with similar performance.
- **Transformer**: A powerful model that uses self-attention to process sequences in parallel, providing superior performance in handling long-range dependencies.

## Key Features

- **Model Implementations**: Code for implementing RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer using popular deep learning libraries.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing techniques to prepare sequence data for each model.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Procedures to train each model on a sequence data task and evaluate their performance.
- **Comparison**: A comprehensive comparison of the models' strengths, weaknesses, and performance on real-world datasets.
