    "# Why RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformers?\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**\n",
    "RNNs were developed to handle sequential data by maintaining a \"memory\" of previous inputs in the sequence. They are good for tasks like time series prediction or text generation where past information influences future predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, RNNs have limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vanishing Gradient Problem:** During backpropagation, gradients can get very small, causing learning to stop as you go further back in the sequence. This makes training RNNs on long sequences very hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**\n",
    "LSTM was introduced to address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs. It uses a special memory cell structure that allows the network to \"remember\" information for long periods and is much more effective for longer sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While LSTMs mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, they still have some issues with long-range dependencies and are computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**\n",
    "GRU is a simplified version of LSTM. It combines the forget and input gates into one, which makes it faster to train and requires fewer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "GRUs might not handle very long sequences as well as LSTMs due to fewer gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Transformers**\n",
    "Transformers solve the problem of long-range dependencies. Instead of relying on sequential processing, transformers use self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh all parts of the sequence at once. This makes transformers faster and better at handling very long sequences. They are currently the state-of-the-art for most sequence modeling tasks, including NLP tasks like machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers can be very computationally expensive because of their attention mechanism, which needs to evaluate pairwise relations between every token in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Setup**\n",
    "We’ll use the sklearn.datasets and work with the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which is often used for text classification. We'll preprocess it into sequences suitable for RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll split the dataset into three sets: Train, Validation (Eval), and Test.\n",
    "\n"
